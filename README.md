The Enhanced Autotyper is a powerful, customizable tool that allows you to automate typing tasks on your computer. Whether you need to repeatedly type the same text, or generate human-like typing patterns, this application has you covered.

## Features ✨

- **Customizable Typing Speed**: Set the characters per minute (CPM) to adjust the typing speed to your preference.
- **Delay Between Words**: Control the delay between words to create a more natural typing rhythm.
- **Random Speed Variation**: Enable a "human-like" mode that introduces random speed variations for each word, making the typing appear more natural.
- **Multi-line Text Input**: Type and automate long passages of text, not just single lines.
- **Hotkey Controls**: Start and stop the typing process using customizable global hotkeys (e.g., Alt+S, Alt+X).
- **Easy-to-Use Interface**: The clean and intuitive graphical user interface makes the Autotyper simple to operate.
